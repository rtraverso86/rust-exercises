# Pig-Latin Exercise

The following is an exercise proposed in Section 8.3 of the Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html

Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead (“apple” becomes “apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!
