# Employee Manager

The following is an exercise proposed in Section 8.3 of the Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html

Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.
